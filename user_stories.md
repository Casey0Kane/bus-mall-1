- As part of  **Marketing Research Team** I want:
    - the number of times a certain image was clicked
    - the percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown.
    - the results of clicks to be shown only after 25 clicks.
    - every image displayed to be the same size.
- As a **Developer** I want:
    - the click data in a list format so that my my client can view the information.
    - the style of the page to look clean and good.
    - the images should not duplicate in that instance and should duplicate with the next three images right after.
    - to use only one event listener and handler.
    - to use object-oriented programming to build this site, so that the site will be more effective and the code will be easier to read and understand.
